Some mouth shutters.

## Why Ruby (on Rails)

Agile as hell programing language from Japan. So much dynamics it's almost
unbearable. Many good old names in industry are folowing Matz. We simply love
it even if it's slow.

Rails is new age framework which is best desribed with DRY. Also many good
people are building it.

tested and accepted protocol and format (HTTP)

Some examples from akropolis and so.

## With which tools

Rails and Cloudkit. Also good use case for key:value dbs. Some examples.

## Final summary
